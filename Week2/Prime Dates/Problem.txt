In this challenge, the task is to debug the existing code to successfully execute all provided test files.

Given two dates each in the format dd-mm-yyyy, you have to find the number of lucky dates between them (inclusive). To see if a date is lucky,

Firstly, sequentially concatinate the date, month and year, into a new integer  erasing the leading zeroes.
Now if  is divisible by either  or , then we call the date a lucky date.
For example, let's take the date "02-08-2024". After concatinating the day, month and year, we get  = 2082024. As  is divisible by  so the date "02-08-2024" is called a lucky date.

Debug the given function findPrimeDates and/or other lines of code, to find the correct lucky dates from the given input.

Note: You can modify at most five lines in the given code and you cannot add or remove lines to the code.
